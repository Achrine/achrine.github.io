Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. This'll mostly be a place to test out web technologies as I learn them, and to write about my experiences in learning the technology.
